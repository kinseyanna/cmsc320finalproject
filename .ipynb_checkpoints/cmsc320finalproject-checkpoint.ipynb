    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is surrounding the Twitter account of the United States' current president, Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump). We focused on the sentiment of the tweets of this account versus each individual tweet's replies. Our intention was to find out the difference between the sentiment of the tweet and the sentiment of its replies, and how it would reflect our current political climate. <b>Our hypothesis was that Donald Trump's account would have more negative replies to his positive tweets, since the current political climate (especially on December 9th, 2017, the date that we chose to analyze his tweets) does not favor Donald Trump.</b>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a way of classifying a text as having a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using text analysis. Just using sentiment analysis should be enough for us to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. However, <b>sentiment analysis has not been able to fully detect things such as sarcasm and satire</b>, and Trump's replies are full of people who are using sarcasm and satire. He has even been called the \"Most Trolled Person On the Internet\" by a news outlet (https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Heres-Why-Donald-Trump-Is-The-Most-Trolled-Person-On-The-Internet-These-Days/). Therefore, we had to think of other features to incorporate in order to truly analyze the sentimentality of each tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: <b>We did not use these extra feature vectors on Trump's tweets</b>, since there was a very low probability that Trump was being sarcastic in his tweets, as when he is being \"sarcastic\", he is actually just making a negative comment about a person or organization and says it is misinterpreted (http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/times-donald-trump-sarcastic-misinterpreted/story?id=41328374). Instead, we used these feature vectors on Trump's followers and the sample of replies we collected from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The features in our feature vector are as follows: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first feature was the original sentiment analysis, because although it is not reliably conclusive on its own, it can give us a basis about the mood of the sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature we worked on focused on the user who posted the reply to the specific tweet. We checked whether or not the user was following other accounts that aligned with Donald Trump's or BLM's views, including politicians of either party.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third feature we worked on also focused on the user who posted the reply to the specific tweet. We compared the user's hashtags for the last year to known Trump-positive and BLM-positive hashtags, and noted numerically the number of hashtags that were similar for each user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After we collected the features, we used the <b> name of classifier </b> to classify the data. Since the dataset we used was small (for reasons that will be explained further in this notebook), we created the training dataset ourselves and compared that to the real dataset using that classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be organized into four parts: Data Extraction, Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Each part will show how we manipulated the Twitter's API in order to get the tweets that we need and come to the conclusion that we have. "

However, since Twitter has a rule of a maximum of 15 queries in 15 minutes, and we were querying for replies of more than 15 tweets, we had to find another way to access the data when working with it. Since Donald Trump also tweets really often each day, and we were only able to slowly get the data, we decided to analyze the data from his tweets on December 9th, 2017, and their replies. December 9th was the date we chose because Trump had tweeted a mix of controversial and non-controversial tweets that day, and then we could see whether or not the sentimentality of the replies for each tweet was being affected by the controversiality of each tweet itself. Their replies were not dated, but we chose them randomly from the total replies to each tweet. We added the tweets of that day and their replies to individual CSVs to work with them. We slowly added them to these CSVs to circumvent the 15-queries-maximum rule.\n",

Therefore, we're going to need other ways of telling whether or not a person is being negative."

Starting at 0, if they’re following people that are known to be pro Donald Trump or generally Republican they are added 1 to their score, similarly if they are following people that are known to be against Donald Trump or generally Democratic they are subtracted one from their score. We created these lists of \"left\" and \"right\" follower handles from research into prominent pro- and con-Donald Trump Twitter users, and from our own experience of using Twitter. Again, due to api's rate limit this took very long time and we had to store the results in a CSV file. "

These tweet histories were obtained using [a script from the Github user yanofsky](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496). This script allows us to get up to 3240 tweets from the selected user's tweet history.\n",

    "The script uses tweepy, which unfortunately does impose limits on the results it gives. Tweepy will only allow us to access tweets posted within the past 1–2 weeks. Because we are trying to find out about the political alignment of a particular user, that is not ideal. However, it is important to consider that people can and do change over time. The hashtags we use to create this feature vector represent the user's political leanings near the time of their reply to President Trump's tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, we only have 195 unique users whose tweet history we can gather. However, one user (SueMarvin3), has made her settings private so that we cannot access her tweet history. So we have a total of 194 unique users whose tweets we can gather. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function below works as follows: A given user's tweet history is read in from his or her file. Each tweet is split up into words, and words that start with the # character are appended to a list. The function then iterates through that list, adding 1 to an integer if the hashtag is \"right-wing\" or subtracting one if it is \"left-wing\". That \"alignment\" value is then returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user uses a given hashtag more than once, that will factor into the score. This is because the more times a hashtag is used, the more passionate the user is presumed to be about that topic, and by extension, about that end of the political spectrum"
