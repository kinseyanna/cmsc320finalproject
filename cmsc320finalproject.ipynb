    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is surrounding the Twitter account of the United States' current president, Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump). We focused on the sentiment of the tweets of this account versus each individual tweet's replies. Our intention was to find out the difference between the sentiment of the tweet and the sentiment of its replies, and how it would reflect our current political climate. <b>Our hypothesis was that Donald Trump's account would have more negative replies to his positive tweets, since the current political climate (especially on December 9th, 2017, the date that we chose to analyze his tweets) does not favor Donald Trump.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"trump_twitter_image.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a way of classifying a text as having a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using text analysis. Just using sentiment analysis should be enough for us to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. However, <b>sentiment analysis has not been able to fully detect things such as sarcasm and satire</b>, and Trump's replies are full of people who are using sarcasm and satire. He has even been called the \"Most Trolled Person On the Internet\" by a news outlet (https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Heres-Why-Donald-Trump-Is-The-Most-Trolled-Person-On-The-Internet-These-Days/). Therefore, we had to think of other features to incorporate in order to truly analyze the sentimentality of each tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: <b>We did not use these extra feature vectors on Trump's tweets</b>, since there was a very low probability that Trump was being sarcastic in his tweets, as when he is being \"sarcastic\", he is actually just making a negative comment about a person or organization and says it is misinterpreted (http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/times-donald-trump-sarcastic-misinterpreted/story?id=41328374). Instead, we used these feature vectors on Trump's followers and the sample of replies we collected from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The features in our feature vector are as follows: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first feature was the original sentiment analysis, because although it is not reliably conclusive on its own, it can give us a basis about the mood of the sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature we worked on focused on the user who posted the reply to the specific tweet. We checked whether or not the user was following other accounts that aligned with Donald Trump's or BLM's views, including politicians of either party.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third feature we worked on also focused on the user who posted the reply to the specific tweet. We compared the user's hashtags for the last year to known Trump-positive and BLM-positive hashtags, and noted numerically the number of hashtags that were similar for each user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After we collected the features, we used the <b> name of classifier </b> to classify the data. Since the dataset we used was small (for reasons that will be explained further in this notebook), we created the training dataset ourselves and compared that to the real dataset using that classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be organized into four parts: Data Extraction, Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Each part will show how we manipulated the Twitter's API in order to get the tweets that we need and come to the conclusion that we have. "

    "Once we accessed the data from Twitter's API, we started querying. However, since Twitter has a rule of a maximum of 15 queries in 15 minutes, and we were querying for replies of more than 15 tweets, we had to find another way to access the data when working with it. Since Donald Trump also tweets really often each day, and we were only able to slowly get the data, we decided to analyze the data from his tweets on December 9th, 2017, and their replies. December 9th was the date we chose because Trump had tweeted a mix of controversial and non-controversial tweets that day, and then we could see whether or not the sentimentality of the replies for each tweet was being affected by the controversiality of each tweet itself. Their replies were not dated, but we chose them randomly from the total replies to each tweet. We added the tweets of that day and their replies to individual CSVs to work with them. We slowly added them to these CSVs to circumvent the 15-queries-maximum rule.\n",

Starting at 0, if they’re following people that are known to be pro Donald Trump or generally Republican they are added 1 to their score, similarly if they are following people that are known to be against Donald Trump or generally Democratic they are subtracted one from their score. We created these lists of \"left\" and \"right\" follower handles from research into prominent pro- and con-Donald Trump Twitter users, and from our own experience of using Twitter. Again, due to api's rate limit this took very long time and we had to store the results in a CSV file. "

This script allows us to get up to 3240 tweets from the selected user's tweet history.\n",

    "The script uses tweepy, which unfortunately does impose limits on the results it gives. Tweepy will only allow us to access tweets posted within the past 1–2 weeks. Because we are trying to find out about the political alignment of a particular user, that is not ideal. However, it is important to consider that people can and do change over time. The hashtags we use to create this feature vector represent the user's political leanings near the time of their reply to President Trump's tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, we only have 195 unique users whose tweet history we can gather. However, one user (SueMarvin3), has made her settings private so that we cannot access her tweet history. So we have a total of 194 unique users whose tweets we can gather. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function below works as follows: A given user's tweet history is read in from his or her file. Each tweet is split up into words, and words that start with the # character are appended to a list. The function then iterates through that list, adding 1 to an integer if the hashtag is \"right-wing\" or subtracting one if it is \"left-wing\". That \"alignment\" value is then returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user uses a given hashtag more than once, that will factor into the score. This is because the more times a hashtag is used, the more passionate the user is presumed to be about that topic, and by extension, about that end of the political spectrum"

    "As you can see, our SVM exclusively predicted results of zero, regardless of the sentiment of the presidential tweet to which they were replying. This is the encoded value for what was originally -1, or negative sentiment. While it is not ideal to have the visualization showing the encoded values rather than the original values, it is incredibly difficult to decode the values, and we were  not able to find a way to do so. So the graph must be viewed with encoded values in mind."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Why did the SVM predict exclusively negative reply sentiments?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of factors as to why our SVM could have predicted exclusively negative reply sentiments. Firstly,  our sample was very small compared to most classification datasets, so we couldn’t be as accurate with our features as we could have been with a larger dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, instead of choosing random presidential tweets, we selected only those from a certain day. This may have created a bias, as we did not monitor Trump’s activities for the day, and it's possible that users were responding not only to his tweets but to his offline activities, as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, since we classified our target values for the SVM by hand, there could be inherent bias or misunderstandings in those classifications. Many tweets involve other users in conversations, and without knowing the context of the conversation, it's difficult to detect exactly what the sentiment behind each reply was. Still other tweets contained  images that couldn't be seen in the text. We automatically classified such image tweets as neutral, but in reality the images may not have been neutral—for example, they could have been positive or negative reaction GIFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourthly, our hashtag and followers features were computer manually. We did not pull the hashtags and the followers from a certain dataset that was known to encompass all anti- and pro-Trump Twitter users and hashtags, since no such datasets exist. Instead, we strove to generate this information by parsing information about the users and their tweets. It's quite possible that we missed some information regarding folloewrs or hashtags that would be crucial in the interpretation and classification of our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, people who bother replying to any political figure's tweet in general are more likely to have a very strong opinion on the tweet or figure in question, so our data is somewhat biased in that sense, as well. There are not likely to be many neutral tweets in reply to President Trump, but rather either very positive or very negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, creating this project was a learning process. As we scraped, manipulated, and computed data, we realized that the project wasn't as simple as it seemed. We found limitations with Tweepy, such as limits on the number of tweets we could get at one time, or how far back in time we could reach for tweets. We found limitations with NLTK, such as its poor performance in such polarized settings where sarcasm will frequently be involved. We found limitations with using pandas and scikit-learn in tandem, since they require the use of an encoder to work together, and that encoder makes the resulting data much more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway from this project is that there were inherent flaws with the experiment itself. The responses to President Trump were so much more overwhelmingly negative than even we expected them to be that to train an SVM with them resulted in an SVM that appears only to spit out negative values. It certainly does speak to the negative attitude that the majority of vocal Twitter users have toward President Trump. However, were we to run this experiment again, it would be helpful to do it with a more diverse and sizeable dataset. \n"
