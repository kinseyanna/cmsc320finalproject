Ideas for the new project

1. Which account has more negative responses to tweets - Black Lives Matter or Donald Trump? 
  Note - this information would just be from Twitter, no other datasets.
  
2. What are the most ridden pathways from place to place in terms of taxi rides, and for a taxi drive to be most profitable, 
   where should they be near and when at each hour of the day? (For a certain city)
   
3. Using the Billboard database with the features of the top songs over the years and using this to predict a song's popularity.

4. Predicting obesity from various factors (like breastfeeding, which seems unusual and interesting). Data available

5. Finding out which indicators are the most significant when it comes to predicting tornado or severe storm occurrance. Data available
